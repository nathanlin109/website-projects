        <h4>Requirements:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>User Interface-
                <ul>
                    <li>Redesigned labeling</li>
                    <li>Redesigned Fonts</li>

                    <li>Redesigned link to site</li>
                    <li>Redesigned ratings</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>GIPHY API key-
                <ul>
                    <li>We obtained our own unique GIPHY API key: XpCGEWN4Zf8YuBvgJAzJYl2V5TcaZrNl</li>
                </ul>    
            </li>

            <li>Searching-
                <ul>
                    <li>We implemented the “Searching…” spinner whenever the user searches for gifs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Get More-
                <ul>
                    <li>We introduced two sets of forward and previous buttons to get additional gifs. One set is above
                        the gifs provided in the results and the other is immodestly below the gifs provided in the
                        results.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>New Features-
                <ul>
                    <li>We added the capability for the site to save a history of recent searches when using this site.
                        This can be accessed by clicking on the arrow within the search bar then selecting the desired
                        search history.</li>
                    <li>We added the functionality for the site to save a series of favorite gifs by clicking on the
                        “Favorite!” button below the desired gifs then pressing the “Load Favorites!” button next to the
                        “Generate GIFs” button, to load all of the favorited gifs.</li>
                    <li>We added the opportunity for the user to copy the URL of a desired gif to their clipboard by
                        clicking the “Copy!” button below the gif.</li>
                    <li>We added the ability for the user to click on the desired gif and for it to open a new window
                        with the source website for the gif.</li>
                    <li>We altered the ratings of the gifs by color coating them based on rating with green being
                        G-rating, yellow with PG-rating, orange with PG-13-rating, and red with R-rating.</li>
                    <li>We added a way to unfavorite gifs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Work Distribution:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Carson Lampila-
                <ul>
                    <li>11/19/19: I helped implement the ability for the user to save their favorite gifs and then
                        access them.</li>
                    <li>11/19/19: I introduced the ability for the user to copy the URLs of the desired gifs into the
                        user’s clipboard.</li>
                    <li>11/20/19: 11/I worked on the redesigning of the page layout by adding new backgrounds, fonts,
                        labels, buttons, and colors.</li>
                    <li>11/22/19I altered the rating system to change color based on the rating of the gif.</li>
                    <li>11/25/19: I built the documentation of this project with the exception of Nathan’s contributions
                        to the project.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Nahtan Lin-
                <ul>
                    <li>11/18/19: I added the functionality for “next” and “previous” buttons to fetch more gifs or to
                        go to previous gifs.</li>
                    <li>11/18/19: I added a way to save user searches in local storage, which they can access in the
                        search text box. The most recent search is automatically inserted in the search box.</li>
                    <li>11/18/19: I added the gif spinner when the user searches for new gifs.</li>
                    <li>11/18/19: I implemented a way for the user to search for new gifs by pressing enter in the
                        search box without having to use the mouse to click the search button.</li>
                    <li>11/18/19: I implemented a feature that resets the page number back to 0 (shows the first gifs in
                        the list) when the user changes the number of gifs to view.</li>
                    <li>11/20/19: I helped implement the favorite feature that allows users to favorite gifs and
                        retrieve them.</li>
                    <li>11/25/19: I added the ability to unfavorite gifs.</li>
                    <li>11/25/19: I styled the contents of the page so that the results were uniform in size.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Grading:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A
                <ul>
                    <li>We believe the work we have done should be equivalent to a grade of an A, because we have
                        followed all requirements for the page along with adding additional functionality to the page
                        namely the favorite, copy, and recent capabilities, exceeding the requirements specifically, by
                        adding an additional feature outside the required two new features.</li>
                </ul>
